# FantasyFootballPickEm

## Purpose
A little while ago my fantansy football league was struggling to come up with a good way to decide the draft order for each year. Some years we drew names out of a hat. Other years we picked horses in the Kentucky Derby horse race. We wanted a way to determine draft order that was still somehow rooted in football and also had an element of skill instead of 100% luck. 

We came up with the idea of a pick'em league. Each week, the members of the league would pick the winner of each game and send them in to the commisioner. At the end of the week a points was awarded if the winner was picked correctly. Primetime games would be worth two points. At the end of the year the leader in points would get 1st choice in deciding their place in the next years draft order. 2nd place in points would then decide their draft position and so on. 

I created this Discord bot to keep track of the weekly games, the league members picks, caclulate scores, and store the leaderboard.

## Technologies Used
This bot was written in Javascript using the Discord.js library to do the heavy lifting. MongoDB is used as the backed to store the users and weekly games data. The bot is hosted on Heroku so will always be available during the season as well as the offseason.
